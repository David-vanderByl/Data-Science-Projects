The data cleaning projects within this repository highlight the importance and necessity of data preprocessing in any data science workflow. Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, these projects underscore the art of wrangling data into a suitable format for analysis. From handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, to dealing with outliers, these projects cover a vast spectrum of data cleaning techniques.

Visualisation is a powerful tool for communicating complex data stories. In this section, projects underscore the capacity to convert raw data into insightful visual narratives using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Through a balanced mix of bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more, these projects demonstrate the value of visualisation in conveying patterns and correlations present in the data.

- Visualisation - Politics and Exchange Rates

## **Machine Learning**

Machine learning is an intrinsic part of modern data science. The projects in this section demonstrate a strong foundation in machine learning concepts, coupled with the ability to implement, evaluate, and fine-tune models using the Scikit-learn library in Python. From building predictive models to understanding the importance of model validation, these projects cover an array of machine learning techniques.

- Supervised Machine Learning - Predicting Heart Disease

## **Probability and Statistics**

Probability and statistics serve as the bedrock of data science. The projects in this section apply these fundamental concepts to real-world problems, illustrating how mathematical theory can drive practical solutions. These projects explore statistical hypothesis testing, Bayesian probabilities, distribution analysis, and more, thereby presenting an integrated view of statistics and probability in action.
